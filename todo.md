##The official saarch.com to-do list

###High Priority
-	Make placeholder images work with the masonry plugin. This shouldn't be too tough, but my brain is relatively fried.
-	Figure out why masonry isn't working on the first load. Document.ready should address this, right?
-	Make 8 project images on main page dynamic, pulled from the first 8 projects on the project list. Maybe randomize it? Or, have projects tagged "Featured", and have Kirby look for that?

###Standard Priority
-	Make standard pages (About Us, Services) dynamic and linked to Kirby.
-	Make team page dynamic, with its own folder, similar to the project folder. WS/CMA/JC/EA should be 01-04, so they are pulled first. The about us template would just pull the first four people in the folder.
-	Make "Our Clients" list dynamic.
-	Make "Awards & Publications" list dynamic.

###Low Priority
-	Send out templates to everyone, asking for a one-sentence description.
-	Take headshots. Make these interactive, somehow. Animated gifs, that are randomly loaded?
-	Fix images from blog. Add all images from previous posts.
