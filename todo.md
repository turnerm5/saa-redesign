-	Add all related projects
-	Add project text

-	What are the 4-6 sections for the "What We Do" section?

###Standard Priority

-	Fix Twitter logo at bottom. Center vertically in footer.

###Low Priority
-	Switch to Kirby 2 (Once plugins are working)
-	Make related projects dynamic. Search by project tag. If all match, rank #1, if two match, rank #2. If none match, default to ???
-	Send out templates to everyone, asking for a one-sentence description.
-	Take headshots. Make these interactive, somehow. Animated gifs, that are randomly loaded?
