##The official saarch.com to-do list

###High Priority
-	Make top-level featured projects dynamic as well. Tag line, big photo, link to page.
-	Make related projects dynamic. Search by project tag. If all match, rank #1, if two match, rank #2. If none match, default to ???

###Standard Priority
-	If image has only one, make it take up the whole column.
-	Make standard pages (About Us, Services) dynamic and linked to Kirby.
-	Make team page dynamic, with its own folder, similar to the project folder. WS/CMA/JC/EA should be 01-04, so they are pulled first. The about us template would just pull the first four people in the folder.
-	Make "Our Clients" list dynamic.
-	Make "Awards & Publications" list dynamic.

###Low Priority
-	Send out templates to everyone, asking for a one-sentence description.
-	Take headshots. Make these interactive, somehow. Animated gifs, that are randomly loaded?
-	Fix images from blog. Add all images from previous posts.
