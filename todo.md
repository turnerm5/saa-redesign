##The official saarch.com to-do list

###High Priority
-	Add all project images
-	Add all related projects
-	Add project text
-	Add search functionality to project page (whole site?)
-	Add thumbnails for each project, to pull up on related page and projects page (In progress)

###Standard Priority
-	Send to test by all staff
-	Make links more clear. When do they have an underline? When do they not?
-	Make filter buttons at top of Projects page a bite more "button-like"
-	Fix Twitter logo at bottom. Center vertically in footer.
-	Make top-level featured projects on the homepage dynamic as well. Tag line, big photo, link to page.
-	Write short paragraph for "Our Services" sections.
-	Write About Us/Our Practice section.
-	Add popover information for each staff member.
-	Trim down project text. Two paragraphs at most.
-	Add office working images. (Crit? Charrette?)
-	Fix images from blog. Add all images from previous posts.

###Low Priority
-	Have one big featured post for the blog
-	Reduce the template-ness of the whole site.
-	Switch to Kirby 2 (Once plugins are working)
-	Make related projects dynamic. Search by project tag. If all match, rank #1, if two match, rank #2. If none match, default to ???
-	Send out templates to everyone, asking for a one-sentence description.
-	Take headshots. Make these interactive, somehow. Animated gifs, that are randomly loaded?
