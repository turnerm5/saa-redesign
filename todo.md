##The official saarch.com to-do list

###High Priority
-	Make images on project page adaptive, so they aren't constrained to 800x600. This may involve implementing a jQuery library that does this automatically, or it may be as simple as changing a line of CSS.
-	Finish project pages. Find if there is a way to automate it, somehow.
-	Automate the project generation

###Standard Priority
-	Make standard pages (About Us, Services) dynamic and linked to Kirby.
-	Make team page dynamic, with its own folder, similar to the project folder. WS/CMA/JC/EA should be 01-04, so they are pulled first. The about us template would just pull the first four people in the folder.
-	Make "Our Clients" list dynamic.
-	Make "Awards & Publications" list dynamic.
-	Move blog entries over. Look if there is a way to do a mass export from Wordpress.

###Low Priority
-	Send out templates to everyone, asking for a one-sentence description.
-	Take headshots. Make these interactive, somehow. Animated gifs, that are randomly loaded?
-	Fix pagination on blog. Make sure it stays at the bottom of the page. Does it just need its own row?
