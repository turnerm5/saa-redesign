Pre-design site selection responded to the long-range vision for the campus master plan, reinforcing the academic core of campus and allowing for future expansion to the north. The building wraps around the Central Utility Plant and creates a new campus green between itself and Mountlake Terrace.

Student circulation patterns favor at-grade circulation paths and the pedestrian “street” that runs north/south along the east side of campus, connecting academic buildings with the student center, cafeteria and parking lots. The SET building responds to the campus circulation patterns by locating the main entrance along the pedestrian “street”.

Internal circulation mirrors the external circulation, opening the center of the building into an atrium that provides student study and lounge spaces and the opportunity for chance encounters between faculty, students, and staff.

The project is targeted LEED Gold.
