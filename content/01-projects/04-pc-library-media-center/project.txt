The Library Media Center is designed to create a gateway to the Peninsula College campus. The Library is organized around a generous reading room. The design marries the information resources of a 21st century media access center with the spatial qualities of a traditional library. The building accommodates both focused, individual study and group activity. Students are able to take classes in the library on information competency in the use of electronic, print and non print information sources.

Sustainability is integrated into the overall design. Heating and cooling are provided by geothermal well fields that supply an underfloor air distribution system. Daylighting reduces the need for electrical lighting. Rain gardens accept run-off from roof surfaces and create lush planting areas that line the pedestrian routes around the building. The project is designed to meet LEED Silver standards.
