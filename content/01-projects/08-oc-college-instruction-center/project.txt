The College Instruction Center houses a 270-seat theater and instructional space for Fine Art, Music and Health Occupations. It is a pivotal project in the realization of the College's master plan. Located at the main entry to campus, the building joins the new Library, Science & Tech and Humanities Buildings to create a central quadrangle. Two city streets will be vacated as part of the project to complete the campus pedestrian spine and create a formal vehicular entry and drop off.

The building's two-story atrium opens into the campus spine, serving as a lobby for the theater, providing student gathering space and creating a sense of community for the multiple programs housed in the facility. Student study and breakout spaces are arranged on multiple levels around the lobby to create a hub of spaces that foster student interaction, encouraging engagement and collaboration.

Active learning classrooms provide a state-of-the art instructional resource based on an innovative model that was pioneered by the University of Minnesota. Round study tables with space for eight students are arranged so that each table has its own LCD wall display and white board. The configuration allows instructors to lecture to the entire class or assign group projects. The video displays are linked so that solutions and discoveries made by one group can be shared with the entire class. The room can accommodate 90 students or be subdivided into two, 45 seat spaces.

Innovative mechanical and electrical systems, including 90% heat recovery and a 100kw solar array, contribute to the building's ambitious sustainable design agenda.
