Expansion of the Auburn Library transforms the 15,000 square foot building to serve contemporary KCLS programs. The glass walls of the 5,000 square foot addition wrap around two sides of the original building, increasing the visibility of the library and opening up to views of Les Gove Park.

Inside, the changes start at the front door, where the entry is modified to increase access. A new central reading area provides a place for people in the heart of the library. Reconfigured collections shelving improves sight lines. The addition contains a new children's area and a flexible meeting room that is contained by operable glass walls that allow it to be used for a wide range of programs. The project includes new parking facilities as well as structural and electrical improvements.
