The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History is a complex project with multiple programs, a beautiful natural site along Mission Creek and a core of historic buildings that are designated City of Santa Barbara Structures of Merit. Founded in 1916 by a small group of enthusiasts, the institution has grown to provide programs that serve a broad audience. The master plan is organized to renew and expand the facilities from 85,000 sf to 124,000 sf.

The master plan calls for the removal of non-significant additions to the historic 1920s and 1930s core of the Museum. The original buildings, which maintain a high degree of integrity on the interior, will be resotred and will continue to be used as exhibit space. Historic photographs will be used to restore the exteriors of the historic buildings once the non-historic additions are removed. New construction on the west side of the campus will house the Museum's Collections and Research Center, additional gallery space and administrative offices.

Project completed in collaboration with local associate Thompson Naylor Architects.
