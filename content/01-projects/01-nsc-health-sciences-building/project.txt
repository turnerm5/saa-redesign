Renovation and expansion of the HSSR Building creates a much-needed hub for community gathering in the heart of campus. A two-story, daylit atrium is the physical and spiritual center of the building and the College, fulfilling the vision of the campus master plan. It is surrounded by a cafe and the Tutoring Center on the ground floor, and science labs, a nursing skills lab and classrooms on the upper floor. The atrium gives the multi-use building a shared sense of community.

The cafe's service and business model, which is modeled after successful formats at four-year schools like the University of Washington, appeals to the contemporary college community. An espresso bar with grab-and-go service is the focal point of the service area. It is open all day. At lunchtime, service expands to include made-to-order sandwiches and salads, and hot dishes.

Moveable walls allow the cafe to be opened into the atrium to accommodate special events and celebrations such as the College's annual Foundation diner. A large sliding glass wall opens the cafe up to an outdoor space that can be used for dining and gathering.

The form of building relates to the existing campus design vernacular. The light steel framed addition floats over the existing, heavy concrete base. A dramatic, cantilevered roof provides iconic front porch making the building visible from a distance, inviting people in to gather.
