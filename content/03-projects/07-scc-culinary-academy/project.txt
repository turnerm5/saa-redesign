Seattle Central's Culinary Academy is a regionally acclaimed program that draws students, faculty, staff and Seattle residents into the College's main building to enjoy its cafe and dining room. A two-story, daylit atrium connects the Academy's student-operated food venues to student activities inside the building and the surrounding urban neighborhood.

The teaching kitchen is a focal point in the dining room. Views into the kitchen are framed by a bamboo paneled wall and service bar giving students an opportunity to demonstrate their skills. Glazed walls in the cafe and dining room connect to the atrium. The cafe's informal environment is designed to feature its menu of espresso, baked goods, pizza and sandwiches. The dining room, which looks out over downtown Seattle, the Space Needle and the Olympic Mountains, provides a formal environment for the Academy's fine cuisine. A changing daily menu features its focus on sustainable foods.

The project includes new academic space for the College's Continuing Education and Instructional Technology programs as well as functional space for receiving and recycling, and offices for the Facilities and Plant Operations departments. It also completes interior pedestrian circulation within the building by creating a public corridor that links the north and south sides of Broadway Edison along Harvard Avenue.
