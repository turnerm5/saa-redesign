This project responds to regional workforce demand by providing a state-of-the-art structure for the College's Allied Health departments. The center also houses the Early Childhood Development programs which consist of early childhood education and childcare facilities for toddlers and preschoolers. The building enables these programs to better serve the educational, economic, health and childcare needs of the North Olympic Peninsula community.

The design of the AH ECDC building responds to the needs of two programs with different functional and operational requirements. Staff supervision, security and privacy for the childcare program is a priority in the Early Childhood Education Center. To enhance security, the Allied Health program and Childhood Education program are given separate entrances. Each child care classroom is given direct access to an outdoor play yard.

The Allied Health program spans both a portion of the ground level and the second floor. A large, open stair connects the two levels at the student study space, allowing for informal interactions between students and faculty from the various Allied Health programs.
