bio: I think architecture can enhance the everyday for anyone. I am interested in architecture as a means of better understanding how people live their lives, how they gather, and how they interact with their environment. I find any project that is built in a way as if “it always belonged on a site” to be inspiring.

My outside interests are drinking too much tea, comedy/story-telling, boat-building, and exploring new places near and far.
