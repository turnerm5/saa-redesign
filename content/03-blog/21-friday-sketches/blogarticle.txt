Text: Revit BIM models, digital renderings, and collaborating with consultants over a virtual meeting are all necessary realities of contemporary architectural practice, but too much of our day-to-day experience is spent sitting in front of a computer screen.  As a variation on our weekly office design crit, SAA took to the streets of downtown Seattle to do a little urban sketching.  Some fresh air and a chance to stretch out some under-used sketching muscles was a great way to close out the week.  Here are some of the results from our trip to Seattle City Hall Plaza.
