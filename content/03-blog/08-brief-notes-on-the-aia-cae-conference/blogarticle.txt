Text: Cima and I recently attended the AIA's <a href="http://network.aia.org/committeeonarchitectureforeducation/home/">Committee on Architecture for Education</a> Fall Conference here in Seattle. The conference was designed to "elevate the level of discourse about design, environmental responsibility, teaching and learning, context, and the development of community partnerships in support of improving the country's learning environments." Very briefly, we wanted to give a few impressions of the conference, which we found quite engaging.

On the first day, one session in particular really stood out to us. The <a href="http://saarch.com/www.cedarriver.org">Friends of the Cedar River Watershed</a> are an amazing group of kids taking ownership of their environment, and getting the community involved and invested in sustainability, through service projects, curriculum development and short films that they make and screen at REI and online.

The event also gave us an opportunity to further develop our understanding of the evolving classroom in a time of great technological change. We started the conference talking about the classroom being just another context for learning, and ended with the idea of MOOC's and how learning and universities are extending their reach, and teaching on the Internet. Our context as architects used to be the physical surroundings for the building, now the physical has blended with the virtual, and the context we need to respond to goes beyond the immediate site. How can we make our buildings work for this new blended reality?
