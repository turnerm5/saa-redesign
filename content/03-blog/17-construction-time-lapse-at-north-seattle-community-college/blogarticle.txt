Text: We've put together a quick time-lapse video showing the construction progress at North Seattle Community College's <a href="http://saarch.com/projects/nscc_tech.php" target="_blank">Allied Health &amp; Technology Building</a>. 

Thanks to the whole project team at North Seattle, automating this time-lapse was remarkably easy. If you're looking to do something similar, we've put together a walkthrough on <a href="http://saarch.com/blog/index.php/2012/11/19/automating-a-construction-time-lapse/">how we did it here</a>.
