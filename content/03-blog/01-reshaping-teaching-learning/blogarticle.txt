Text: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are on their way to changing the delivery of higher education. Just last week [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), the for-profit startup that currently offers MOOCs for free, announced that twelve major research universities including University of Washington had joined their open courseware venture. Again, articles in the press used the words "seismic shift" and "tsunami" relative to the effect MOOCs are having on higher education. In May when the Harvard/MIT open courseware project was announced, planners at the University of Washington voiced guarded interest and noted the many questions surrounding MOOCs ability to truly disrupt higher education. Two months later, however, the UW is partnering with Coursera to deliver courses via MOOCs. With the UW and other major research universities joining the open courseware movement "seismic shift" still sounds extreme but it is clear that change is accelerating.

What does the open courseware movement mean for the architecture of buildings for higher education? Online/e-learning will change teaching and learning and the roles of faculties, and that impacts learning environments. MOOCs, as they are evolving, are proving to be an effective form of delivering content as they are more interactive and conducive to learning. Research is showing that this interactive form of online learning is as effective as the traditional lecture format. And when five thousand students enrolled in a MOOC make the same mistake online, professors can immediately adjust the way material is being taught. Research also shows that learning models which are a blend of online and in-person classes are more effective than the traditional lecture format where students passively listen to delivery of content.

In discussions with UW Associate Dean Kevin Mihata and with Renee Carney, eLearning Manager at [Lower Columbia College](/projects/lcc-master-plan), the open courseware movement will require faculty to acquire new skills. The need for "instructional designers" was noted by both educators. Renae noted that unlike K-12 teachers trained in the science of education, higher education instructors are trained solely in content with content typically delivered in lecture format. New skills based on the science of education, how students learn, and how skills are evaluated will need to be acquired by faculty. As Kevin Mihata noted, in contrast with the lecture format, contact time with students becomes interactive time in blended models. These developments indicate potential outcomes of the open courseware movement.

The changing roles of instructors and pedagogies are impacting the way we are planning facilities for our current community college client, Lower Columbia College. For academic transfer programs which prepare students for upper division learning at four-year institutions, online learning brings into question the need for the lecture hall. If the large lecture hall is no longer necessary, we need to evaluate the proper size classroom that allows flexibility for emerging pedagogies and blended learning models. Furniture and technology play into this discussion as does the number of students the classroom should serve with these pedagogies.

In workforce education, if content is delivered through e-learning, less space will be required for the traditional classroom and master planning could focus on the proper lab environments that convert that knowledge into skills required by employers. And adjacencies of spaces that facilitate informal as well as formal learning must be considered for all programs. When the business model for delivering higher education changes as it will, the facilities that serve higher-ed will change along with it. As designers and planners we must anticipate these changes.
