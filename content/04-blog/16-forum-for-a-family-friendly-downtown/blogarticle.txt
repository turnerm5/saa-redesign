Text: Downtown Seattle is changing. From the investment and redevelopment of South Lake Union, to the approval of the Seattle Waterfront project and reconstruction of the seawall, to the construction of family-friendly housing units from the International District to Capitol Hill, to the ongoing expansion of the bus, rail, and pedestrian networks needed to fuse them into a cohesive whole, the city is undergoing its greatest physical and demographic shift in a generation.

As the number of businesses, green spaces, and cultural amenities in the urban core have grown, countless individuals and, increasingly, families have begun to embrace Seattle’s downtown as a vibrant place not only to work and visit but also to live. With the influx of new residents has come a renewed focus on the quality of life in downtown for families of all sizes, ages, and economic backgrounds. While the city center provides an incredible concentration of services and activities to attract individuals and families, ironically, it often lacks the elements that make it possible for them to stay over the long term.

Amid this groundswell of recent change, The Forum for a Family Friendly Downtown, sponsored by AIA Seattle, attempted last week to view downtown holistically by asking two primary questions: What does a vibrant, flourishing life downtown for people of all ages and backgrounds look like? What additions or changes to existing services and/or the built environment might help encourage and accelerate that development?

In response, myriad speakers including city officials, child psychologists, architects, developers, researchers, and urban planners discussed an array of strategies that are either already underway or are proposed to make downtown a more inviting place for families of various backgrounds and income levels to visit and live. The initiatives discussed ranged from changes at the city scale like those being undertaken in the Waterfront Seattle project or the Bicycle Master Plan, to the scale of individual “festival” streets that can be shut down periodically for people to gather throughout the year, to individual businesses who have reclaimed a single parking space on the street for bike corals and public seating.

In each case, the benefits and challenges of downtown life was assessed through the lens of making Seattle an attractive and safe place to live, especially for seniors and parents with young children. Particular attention was paid to retaining those families who are already living in the urban core. For while many of the same young professionals or couples who move to the city prior to starting a family would like to remain after having children, they are often forced to move away from downtown as their needs and focus shift to those services that children require. Of the numerous factors contributing to the loss of families from the downtown, none eclipsed the need for larger, more affordable living spaces and, above all, schools.

As was noted by numerous speakers and parents involved in the discussion throughout the day, schools form an undeniable center around which the life of families with young children revolves.  For many, the best aspects of urban life – short commute times, engagement with a diverse community, and easy access to services – were negated by the absence of a public school downtown, for it often resulted in a reverse commute to neighborhoods outside of the urban core.  Recognizing this need, the Seattle School Board has included a feasibility study for a downtown school as part of the upcoming levy program for Seattle’s K-12 schools. However, the absence of any city-owned property of sufficient size for a school means that a great deal of effort and additional study will be needed in a short time frame if the desire to re-establish a school downtown is to keep pace with the surge of new residents.

Finally, the changes to Seattle’s downtown to make it a more welcoming place for families and seniors are a good thing for everyone. A central thread running through the forum was how designing spaces in which families in general, and children and seniors in particular, feel comfortable contributes to the overall sense of safety of comfort with the urban experience for people of all ages.  From better bike lanes to safer, more dynamic parks, placing families at the center of the design and planning process helps build into the very foundation of the city an infrastructure for improving health through simple embedded and free activities like walking, biking, or just playing at a playground, as well as an opportunity for spending more time in community, with our neighbors, families, and children.
