Text: Myself and a few of the architects from Schacht Aslani recently attended <a href="http://alejandroecheverriarquitectos.tumblr.com/">Alejandro Echeverri</a>'s lecture at <a href="http://www.themakersspace.com/">The Maker's Space</a>, presented by <a href="http://spacecityseattle.org/">Space.City</a>.

"In addition to his strong architectural practice and teaching, as Director of Urban Projects, Echeverri has played crucial role in the rejuvenation of Medellin, Colombia. With the support and partnership of the city's mayor, Sergio Fajardo, Echeverri established public works programs and initiated building a series of visually striking libraries, schools, parks, and community centers in Medellin's most impoverished areas, including the an elevated gondola tramway that connects some of Medellin's poorest and most isolated neighborhoods to the rest of the city. Because of these efforts and the belief in the power of design, Medellin's crime rate has significantly declined and the city is now considered a blueprint for the future of other cities in the developing world."</blockquote>
To me, the on-going work in Medellin speaks to the breadth and complexity of acting positively and purposefully within the built environment. The people advocating for change in Medellin made a purposeful decision to look clearly at reality and map the city as both the formalized built spaces and the informal built spaces, and to direct their efforts towards the conditions of life at the informal edges. By analyzing the conditions of the city, the people pushing for change pursued infrastructural and cultural projects that stitch together zonas previously separated by topographical and territorial boundaries, creating new public spaces that are no longer controlled by drug cartels. It is inspiring to see politics and cultural values align so that design projects can enact such powerful change. However, it is also interesting to recognize that those conditions do not exist everywhere and that ultimately the projects will cause many different changes.

One of the questions raised during the discussion period addressed the nature of property ownership and rights, questioning how the creation of formalized public infrastructure and cultural centers in informal neighborhoods changes the property rights of the marginalized people who live in the surrounding area. There is no immediate answer, but the question again points to the complexity of the issue and to how fundamentally different Medellin is from a place like Seattle. Perhaps the best message I took away from the lecture is that the efforts in Medellin are doing their best to look clearly at reality and then opening their thinking to how those challenges can be addressed. How the process unfolds from there is undetermined, but to act creatively requires first seeing the conditions clearly.
