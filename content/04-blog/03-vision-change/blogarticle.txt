Text: The last session of the 2012 CEFPI Pacific Northwest Regional Conference introduced the concept of pre-design for K-12 schools. The design of K-12 schools must respond to rapidly changing expectations for teaching and learning. In this context pre-design has value as a step in the design process. The presentation focused on the steps that should be part of a K-12 pre-design starting with discovery and visioning as precedents to planning and testing programmatic concepts. Discovery involves an information gathering process that leads collaboratively to a vision for the proposed project. Thus the stakeholders have ownership of the vision, which is critical if the vision changes the way people are used to doing things.

Our experience with designing the <a href="http://saarch.com/ocee.php">Opportunity Center for Employment and Education</a> (OCEE) supports this notion. pre-design, which is mandated for public higher education facilities, had real value in linking the discovery process with vision. For the OCEE the process just happened in reverse order as the vision for a new service model for delivery of employment, education, and social services on a community college campus envisioned by Speaker of the House, Frank Chopp, preceded the information gathering and discovery exercises. The pre-design was then a process of vetting that vision with the public agencies that would implement this vision on a day to day basis. It was not the easy route but it did get the project moving forward as many of the agencies' concerns were addressed in pre-design. The agencies also saw the benefits of the proposed project and there was no backtracking in later design phases. Now after a year of occupying the finished building, the agencies in the OCEE are working collaboratively with success to implement the new service model.

New methods of teaching and learning are not always embraced by the teachers that have to implement them as was presented in the session on British Columbia's 21st Century Learning Initiative. As a result the architects had to be creative in designing schools with "one foot in the 20th century and the other in the 21st." A pre-design process that linked the vision which came from above (the Superintendant's office) with a discovery process of what that vision could achieve for teaching and learning could have been of value in implementing the well researched learning initiative with teachers.

Change is a constant in our world today and it is often hard to accept. Vision and change often go hand in hand. Vision that comes from above is at times necessary in order to move new ideas forward. A pre-design process that explores the benefits as well as the concerns that inevitably come with changing expectations for teaching and learning could benefit school districts, the community, architects, and the teachers who are on the front lines for educating our children.
