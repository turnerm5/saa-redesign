Text: Much has been written about the Great Disruption of higher education driven by the open courseware movement. The discussion has recently ramped up again with the announcement that Harvard and MIT will be putting their courses online, and with the emergence of two for-profit startups headed by Stanford University faculty. The open courseware movement has been around for at least ten years when MIT first put its courses online but the question still is when and how this Great Disruption will actually take place. As further evidence, the Society for College and University Planning (SCUP) will be taking up Change-Disruption in the March 2013 issue of Planning for Higher Education. As architects whose focus and passion is designing learning environments for higher education we are monitoring these changes.

Considering music and print media, industries that were disrupted by the Internet, there were issues of supply and demand that controlled the speed of change. The low barriers to entry on the Internet allowed alternative supply models to emerge quickly and cheaply, dramatically changing the business model for these industries. With higher education, we have not seen that rate of change, primarily because the suppliers still control the means of admission and accreditation which are valued components for students and their future employers. But there is evidence that change is happening as others are increasingly contributing to the supply side.

I recently met with Dr. Kevin Mihata, Associate Dean for Educational Programs at the University of Washington, to discuss the impact of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the UW’s thinking about the delivery of higher education. While we discussed a variety of issues related to this subject, the issue of “brand” is one that appears to be driving change at the top. Now that more elite institutions are becoming involved in the open courseware movement others are taking notice and getting into the game, including top tier public universities.

Elite institutions will not likely dilute a solid brand by giving degrees online to the masses. They will, however, undoubtedly learn much about pedagogy from MOOCs which will only strengthen their brand for the future. One of the for-profit startups, Coursera, partners with institutions to host courses online. Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, University of Michigan, Princeton and University of Pennsylvania have all signed up with Coursera. University of Washington is considering its options with respect to joining the open courseware movement.

While being on the cutting edge of pedagogy through MOOCs drives institutions at the top to change, back door means, driven by motivated students and faculty are emerging and will drive change from the bottom up. Founded in 2007, the Community College Consortium for Open Educational Resources strives to work with faculty to improve teaching and learning while increasing educational access using open educational resources. Another consortium, the Open Courseware Consortium, promotes the adoption of open educational recourses and shares best practices. Motivated students who gain knowledge through online means and then pass a test or demonstrate skills through alternate presentation methods could drive change in the way parts of curriculum are delivered. With private for-profits linked with elite institutions exploring the means to deliver cost effective and accredited courses, and consortiums of public institutions working to increase access to higher education through online resources, changes in the supply side will eventually affect the business model for higher education. Change linked with technology always happens faster than expected and we are entering that cycle with higher education.
