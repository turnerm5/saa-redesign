Text: Our approach to the campus master plan for Lower Columbia College and the design of a new arts and health occupations building at Olympic College reflect the impact of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on higher education. Lower Columbia’s master plan considers changing role of the campus in education as the capacity of open, online courses to reduce the need for lecture-based classes to take place at the College. Spaces that accommodate experiential learning will become a focus of the campus. In workforce education, for example, general content will probably be delivered online. Vocational labs will be designed to simulate workplace environments, enabling students to engage in skills development allows them to prepare for employment.



Classrooms will be designed as active learning spaces, promoting face-to-face engagement, taking advantage of digital tools and online resources, and serving the needs of hybrid courses. Classroom sizes, instructional technology, furniture and equipment will be evaluated as part of the process. Campus-wide technology infrastructure to support online learning will be a fundamental component of the master plan.

Lower Columbia College’s library, which has already changed from a place for quiet, individual study to a space that accommodates interactive learning and group study, will continue to evolve. In the future it needs to support collaborative, project based learning and provide places for students who meet through online peer review to get together in person. Coursera’s programs reveal that online connections between students enrolled in a MOOC encourage person-to-person meetings. Coursera’s founders planned a party for students who completed their first course and discovered that a thousand students wanted to attend.

The College Instruction Center will provide space for Olympic College’s fine arts, music, performing arts and health occupations programs. The mission of the project is to create a facility that brings all of its students together to create a community of learners.

The building is organized in plan and section to give each discipline a sense of place and promote efficiency for students, faculty and staff. The public spaces in the building are designed to create connections between the programs, encouraging interaction between disciplines. Atrium spaces and open stairwells allow views through the building that create a sense of the whole. Transparency, both inside and out, makes each program visible, engaging people in the dynamic activity that occurs in the building – making art, making music, working in health occupations skills labs. In a sense all of the programs share a vocational orientation due to the hands-on nature of their learning environments. Informal student study spaces are located in proximity to the stairs that connect the building vertically. These “hub zones” provide places for students to assemble in small groups, work on projects and share ideas. They provide the social spaces that will be a magnet for coming to campus in the evolving model of higher education.

At the capital request and predesign phases the project included a 75 seat lecture hall. During the schematic design, the fixed seat space is being replaced by smaller, more flexible, flat floor learning environments. An active learning lab that will serve all of the programs is being designed to facilitate group work on projects and one-to-one engagement between students and faculty. The space will be located on the ground floor of the building, directly connected to the lobby where it is highly visible and easily accessed.

The future of higher education, in the age of MOOCs both challenges and stimulates administrators, faculty, staff and students to rethink the nature of the learning experience. The role of a physical campus will be transformed as a result. At the same time, a fundamental aspect of the academic experience is being reaffirmed. The role of an academic campus as a place that fosters interaction, promotes dialogue and makes palpable a sense of community is likely to be at the heart of planning and design for the future.
