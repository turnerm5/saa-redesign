Text: As architects we always hear that the relationship between the owner and architect is the key to a successful project. I agree that that is extremely important and crucial to the livelihood of our practice, but also believe that that there is another partner that is needed to make a project successful, and that is the Contractor. Without a strong relationship between the contractor and the architect, the owner's	vision cannot become reality.

At Schacht Aslani Architects we strive to develop a mutual respect between both professions with the understanding that we can both learn from each other. People get into each profession out of the love of craft; both have decide to put our minds and hands together to create and build. Our willingness to learn from the past and those who came before us has made us better at what we do. I continue to believe that we can continue to develop strong relationships based on this shared background, and work together to build better structures.

I have been in this business long enough to see the huge amount of evolution and change. Technology has changed how architects design and document buildings and how contractors manage and construct buildings. For example, technology has radically changed how we communicate with each other in the field. Days of faxing information back and forth during construction are extremely rare, if not non-existent. With this rise in efficiency, owners expect projects to be completed faster than ever before and on a tighter budget. Technology such as BIM, mobile devices, and shared planrooms help with this, but it still takes a willingness to work together as a cohesive whole during construction.

In a marriage of science and art, buildings have become more complicated throughout the years. It must be human nature to try and always push the envelope and create better buildings than the generation that came before. In order to do this though, it takes contractors who are willing to join a team and help develop the owners dream and architects vision. I look forward to working with contractors who are willing to understand the project goals and understand the "why" behind the building.

I'd love to hear from any contractors who we have had an opportunity to work with and others we have not had the privilege. I am interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can work and come together to implement the owners dream and our designs in a more cohesive approach. If you have any thoughts or comments send them to <a href="mailto:chris@saarch.com">chris@saarch.com</a>. I hope this blog will be the beginning of many discussions and learning experiences.
